> Before enabling Basic auth for your site you need to understand [how nginx includes work in wp-project]({% post_url 2016-11-29-custom-includes %}).

Basic auth is used for restricting access to your site. This is useful for public testing/staging environments. This way only you and the client can access the page.

## For example: Basic auth for staging environment

Add `nginx/environments/staging/basic-auth.conf.tmpl` with:
```
##
# Use password for staging environment
##
auth_basic           "Restricted environment";
auth_basic_user_file ${__DIR__}/.htpasswd;
```

Generate new password hash using openssl:
```bash
$ openssl passwd -crypt "password"
WjwOpfuB2pppo
```

And add username and password hash into `nginx/environments/staging/.htpasswd` like:
```
user:WjwOpfuB2pppo
```
