## Missing object-cache.php error
When using earlier version of wp-project you might get error like:

```
fopen(/var/www/project/web/app/plugins/redis-cache//includes/object-cache.php): failed to open stream: No such file or directory
```

This is can be fixed by replacing `"wpackagist-plugin/redis-cache": "*"` -> `"devgeniem/wp-redis-object-cache-dropin": "*"` in your `composer.json`.

## Can I create missing folders inside nginx/?
Ofc you can, `mkidr` or `touch` and be like a unicorn!

## I cant see locally uploaded images
This may happen because nginx coudnt notice file creation event.
You can fix this by running `gdev reload`

## In local development I get error notice about wordpress cant connect to wordpress.org servers 
Somehow your local development environment cant reach internet during loading of wp core. To fix this just disable WP_DEBUG in `development.php` so that it looks like this ` define( 'WP_DEBUG', false );`
