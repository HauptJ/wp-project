## Missing object-cache.php error
When using earlier version of wp-project you might get error like:

```
fopen(/var/www/project/web/app/plugins/redis-cache//includes/object-cache.php): failed to open stream: No such file or directory
```

This is can be fixed by replacing `"wpackagist-plugin/redis-cache": "*"` -> `"devgeniem/wp-redis-object-cache-dropin": "*"` in your `composer.json`.

## Can I create missing folders/ files?
Ofc you can, `mkidr` or `touch` and be like a unicorn!
