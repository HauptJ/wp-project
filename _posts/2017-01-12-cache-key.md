This page shows how to change cache key for nginx http cache.

You can change the environment variable `NGINX_CACHE_KEY` defines the redis path which nginx will use to retrieve/store cached http responses.

All nginx variables can be used in the cache key.

Best practise for caching is to cache as much as possible but to avoid duplicate contents in different cache keys as much as possible.

## Default value for NGINX_CACHE_KEY

Cache key uses the same `wp_` prefix as the databases use so that we can flush the nginx cache with `$ wp cache flush` command.

```
wp_:nginx:$real_scheme$request_method$host$request_uri
```

**Note:** If you want to add this into `docker-compose.yml` you need to escape dollars and provide the cache key like this:

```
NGINX_CACHE_KEY: "wp_:nginx:$$real_scheme$$request_method$$host$$request_uri"
```

## Example: Cache needs to respect accept-language header
Nginx configs automatically add few helper variables which you can use

```
# This variable contains 2 first letters of accept-language header, for example 'fi', 'sv', 'de'
# If that header is not provided this will be 'en'

$prefer_language_slug
```

Add this variable into cache key
```
wp_:nginx:$prefer_language_slug:$real_scheme$request_method$host$request_uri
```
